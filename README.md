# auto_pypi

This is a shell script to auto setup your (updated version) python package onto Pypi. 


## Usage

- Copy the `setup_new_pypi.sh` file into your python package's root folder (where the `setup.py` exists). 

- Run `setup_new_pypi.sh` under your python package's root folder in terminal, *providing your package's name* : 
  - $ `./setup_new_pypi.sh your-package-name`

- Then you'll be asked to input the new version number to continue. 

- Then you'll be asked to input the username and passcode of PyPi as usual.
