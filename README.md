# auto_pypi

This is a shell script to auto setup your (updated version) python package onto Pypi. 


## Usage

- Copy the `setup_new_pypi.sh` file into your python package's root folder (where the `setup.py` exists). 

- In terminal (under your python package's root folder), run: `$ ./setup_new_pypi your-package-name`

- Then you'll be asked to input the new version number to continue. 

- Then you'll be asked to input the username and passcode of PyPi as usual.
